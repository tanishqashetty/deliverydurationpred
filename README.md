Delivery Duration Prediction

This is a model that is used to predict the time taken to deliver an order from DoorDash. This includes the start of the time right from placement of the order by the users to the order being delivered by the Dasher to their doorstep.

The data has been extracted from the StartaScratch platform as a data science project for my portfolio.
